### Project Overview

The website demonstrates foundational front-end skills, focusing on structure and styling with traditional HTML and CSS. It does not use modern tags, properties, or advanced features, making it ideal for learning the basics.

### Project Sections

The Coffee Website is organized into several key sections:

- **Home Page:** Welcomes visitors with a coffee-themed introduction and imagery.
- **Menu:** Displays a selection of coffee drinks and descriptions.
- **About Us:** Shares information about the coffee shop and its story.
- **Contact:** Provides details for reaching out, such as email or location.

Each section is designed using basic HTML elements and styled with classic CSS, focusing on layout and visual appeal without modern HTML5 or CSS3 features.
